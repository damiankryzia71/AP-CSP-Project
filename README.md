# AP-CSP-Project
AP Computer Science Principles - AP Exam Project

This is the repository for my AP Computer Science Principles final project.
I am the only creator of this project.
This repository contains the main python file for the project, as well as a file with used sources and a folder with used images.

This project was designed using older Python code and TKinter module. It might not work correctly on some devices and software before translation to newer code.
